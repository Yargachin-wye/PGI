1:1
In the name of Allah, the Merciful, the Merciful!
This means: I am starting in the name of Allah. From the lexical analysis of this phrase, it is clear that all the beautiful names of the Supreme Lord are meant. Allah is one of these names, meaning "The God Who is deified and worshipped, the only One Who deserves to be worshipped because of His divine qualities - the qualities of perfection and perfection." The beautiful names Merciful and Merciful testify to His great mercy, encompassing every thing and every creature. Allah's mercy will be fully honored by His God-fearing slaves who follow the path of God's prophets and messengers. And all other creatures will receive only a part of God's mercy. It should be known that all righteous theologians unanimously spoke about the need to believe in Allah and His divine qualities. The Lord is Merciful and Merciful, that is, He has mercy, which is manifested on His slaves. All the benefits and bounties are one of the many manifestations of His mercy and compassion. The same can be said about the other names of Allah. He is omniscient, that is, He has knowledge of all things. He is omnipotent, that is, He has power and dominion over every creature..
1:2
Praise be to Allah, the Lord of the Worlds,
These are the words of praise of Allah for the perfect qualities and deeds that He performs either by mercy or by justice. All praise belongs to Him, and He deserves it entirely. He alone dominates all the worlds. All things belong to these worlds, except Allah Himself. He created the universe, provided its inhabitants with the means of subsistence and favored them with great generosity, without which they would not be able to exist. All the benefits that the creatures are blessed with are the gifts of the Most High Lord. The rule of Allah Almighty is of two types: universal and private. Universal domination is expressed in the fact that He creates creatures, sends them food and shows them the right path, so that they can improve their lives in this world. And private domination is manifested in the fact that Allah educates His beloved slaves in the spirit of piety, helps them to acquire and perfect faith, protects them from everything that can lead them astray from the straight path and distance them from It. The essence of this domination is that Allah makes it easier for His servants to go to all good and protects them from all evil. Perhaps that is why the prophets most often called Allah their Lord in their prayers. And the aspirations of these people were connected exclusively with the private rule of Allah Almighty. In this revelation, the Almighty called himself the Lord of the worlds and thereby emphasized that He alone creates, governs and bestows benefits. He is rich and does not need His creations. On the contrary, all creatures need Him and depend on Him comprehensively..
1:3
To the Merciful, the Merciful,
1:4
To the Lord of the Day of Retribution!
A ruler is One who possesses a kingdom and power and, by virtue of this, is free to command and forbid, reward and punish, and have full authority over his subordinates. Who the real power belongs to will become clear on the Day of Retribution. This is one of the epithets of the Day of Resurrection, when people will receive retribution for their good and evil deeds. It is on that Day that God's creations will clearly see the perfection of Allah's authority, the perfection of His justice and wisdom. They will lose everything they had before. Kings and subjects, slaves and free - all will be equal before the Lord, submissive to His majesty and humble before His might. They will await His sentence, crave His reward, and fear His retribution. That is why the Lord called himself the Ruler of the Day of Retribution, although His authority extends to all times..
1:5
You are the only one we worship and You are the only one we ask for help.
According to the grammar of the Arabic language, if the pronoun is placed before the verb, then the action is performed only in relation to the mentioned person and no one else. Therefore, the revelation we are discussing has the following meaning: we worship You and do not worship anyone else, and we cry out for help to You and do not cry out for help to anyone else. Worship is mentioned before a plea for help, and such a turn is an example of including the particular in the general, because when listing the general, it is customary to mention the particular before the particular. Along with this, this sequence of words indicates that the right of Allah Almighty is above the rights of His slaves. Worship is a concept that encompasses all words and deeds performed by both soul and body, which Allah loves and approves of. A plea for help is an appeal to Allah Almighty with a request to bestow good and protect from evil, imbued with the belief that this will certainly come true. It is worship and pleading for help that are the right way to achieve eternal happiness and get rid of all evil. Apart from this, there is no other way to escape. That is why it is very important to know that worship acquires its true meaning only when it is performed for the sake of Allah in full accordance with the instructions of His Messenger, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him. Without fulfilling these two conditions, no worship is possible. Despite the fact that pleading for help is one of the forms of worship, Allah Almighty mentioned it separately, because when performing any rite, the servant of Allah needs the help of his Lord. Without His help, a person will never be able to faithfully fulfill God's commands and avoid sins..
1:6
Lead us in a straight path,
This means: show us the straight path, guide us to it and help us follow them. This clear path leads to Allah and ends in Paradise, and only those who know the truth and are guided by it in their deeds can walk along it. It also means: lead us to a straight path and guide us along it. The first involves converting to Islam and renouncing all other faiths, and the second involves studying the laws of religion and putting them into practice. This prayer is one of the most useful, deep and comprehensive prayers in Islam. Allah has obliged people to call out to Him with these words in every rakat of prayer, because every person needs God's help..
1:7
by those whom You have favored, not those on whom anger has fallen, and not those who have gone astray.
The straight path is the path of the prophets, the faithful believers, the fallen martyrs and the righteous, who were favored by Allah Almighty. This is not the way of those who fell under His wrath, because they saw the truth, but turned away from it. This is exactly the fate that befell the Jews and their kind. And this is not the way of the lost, who turned away from the truth because of their ignorance and delusion, like Christians and their like. Despite its brevity, this surah contains something that is not found in any other Quranic surah. It reflects the three components of monotheism. The belief in the rule of Allah alone is formulated in the words "To the Lord of the worlds." The belief that only Allah is worthy of worship is expressed in the very name "Allah" and in the words "You alone we worship and You alone we pray for help." And the belief that only Allah has beautiful names and perfect qualities stems from the words "praise be to Allah", as mentioned earlier. This component of monotheism implies faith in all the names and qualities of Allah Almighty, by which He described Himself and by which the Prophet Muhammad described Him. At the same time, divine qualities should not be deprived of their true meaning and likened to the qualities of creations. This surah also contains proof of the truth of Muhammad's prophetic mission, which is expressed in the words "Lead us on a straight path." Indeed, this would not have been possible if there had not been a prophetic message. The words "To the Lord of the Day of Retribution" contain an indication that people will certainly receive retribution for what they have done. This retribution will be just, because the word din â€˜retribution' implies just retribution. This surah also exposes the fallacy of the views of the Qadarites and Jabrites, since it states that everything happens according to the predestination of Allah, despite the fact that people have the right to choose. Moreover, it refutes the views of all adherents of heretical and errant movements, because the words "lead us in a straight path" encourage Muslims to learn the truth and be guided by it in their deeds. As for the adherents of heresy, religious innovations and misconceptions, each of them certainly turns away from direct guidance. Along with this, this surah contains a call for sincere service to Allah Almighty and seeking help only from Him. This is the meaning of the words "To You alone we worship and to You alone we pray for help." Praise be to Allah, the Lord of the Worlds!.
